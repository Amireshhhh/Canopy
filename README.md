A joint work with J.Meyer for SoReMo initiative, a publication on the "Analysis on the Persisting Effects of Redlining on Green Infrastructure in Chicago Neighborhoods" 

We analyzed the satellite images of Chicago neighborhoods using public GIS images available at the City of Chicago Portal. We connected them with other datasets from the same portal and combined the analyzed results with several surveys. Our approach opened a new way of analyzing satellite images and connecting them in Python. This motivated us to create an API for big cities in the United States such as New York and Los Angeles  to leverage their current public datasets to make better political or environmental decisions and be more socially responsible.
